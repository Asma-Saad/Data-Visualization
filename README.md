# Data-Visualization
Data visualization is the graphic representation of data. It involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data 
to viewers of the images. This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation
of the visualization. 

here we used 2 libraries to implement data visualization'
first; I used matplotlib which I used it more
then: I used Seaborn ,it gives us more options and styles
